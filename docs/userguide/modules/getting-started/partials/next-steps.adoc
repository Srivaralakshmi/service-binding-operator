By using service bindings, developers are able to more easily leverage the services available to them on a Kubernetes cluster. This method provides
consistency across different services and is repeatable for the developers. Service binding provides a unified way to create a binding connection between
the application and service and eliminates the need for the usual manual and error-prone configuration.
