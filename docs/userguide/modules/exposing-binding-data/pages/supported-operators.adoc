= Known bindable operator-backed services

The {servicebinding-title} can automatically detect and bind to services
created by a limited selection of operators. These operators do not support
binding directly. Instead, the {servicebinding-title} is able to detect and
configure the operator's CRDs so that they become bindable.

The long-term intention is to contribute upstream support for service binding
and remove the operators that gain native support for service bindings. 

The operators that currently fall in this category are:
