[#detection-of-binding-data-through-owned-resources]
= Detection of binding data through owned resources

You can use this method if your backing service owns one or more Kubernetes resources such as route, service, config map, or secret that you can use to detect the binding data. In this method, the {servicebinding-title} detects the binding data from resources owned by the backing service CR.

The following examples show the `detectBindingResources` API option set to `true` in the `ServiceBinding` CR:

.Example
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: binding.operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceBinding
metadata:
  name: etcdbinding
  namespace: service-binding-demo
spec:
  detectBindingResources: true
  services:
    - group: etcd.database.coreos.com
      version: v1beta2
      kind: EtcdCluster
      name: etcd-cluster-example
  application:
    name: java-app
    group: apps
    version: v1
    resource: deployments
----

In the previous example, `EtcdCluster` custom service resource owns one or more Kubernetes resources such as route, service, config map, or secret.

The {servicebinding-title} automatically detects the binding data exposed on each of the owned resources.
